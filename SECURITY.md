## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you discover a security vulnerability in the gRPC Process Migration Control system, please follow these steps:

### 1. Do Not Create Public Issues

Please **do not** create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities. This helps protect users while we work on a fix.

### 2. Report Privately

Send details to the project maintainers through one of these channels:
- Create a private security advisory on GitHub
- Send an email with details to the project maintainers

### 3. Include Details

Please include as much information as possible:
- Description of the vulnerability
- Steps to reproduce the issue
- Potential impact assessment
- Suggested fixes (if any)
- Your contact information

### 4. Response Timeline

We aim to:
- Acknowledge receipt within 48 hours
- Provide an initial assessment within 7 days
- Release security fixes based on severity:
  - Critical: Within 1-3 days
  - High: Within 7 days
  - Medium: Within 30 days
  - Low: With next regular release

## Security Considerations

### Current Security Status

**Development Configuration:**
- gRPC services run on insecure channels for development
- No authentication or authorization mechanisms
- In-memory storage without persistence
- API endpoints are open without rate limiting

### Production Recommendations

For production deployments, implement these security measures:

#### 1. gRPC Security
```bash
# Enable TLS for gRPC services
GRPC_TLS_ENABLED=true
GRPC_CERT_PATH=/path/to/cert.pem
GRPC_KEY_PATH=/path/to/key.pem
```

#### 2. API Security
- Implement authentication (JWT tokens recommended)
- Add rate limiting for API endpoints
- Validate all input data
- Enable CORS with specific origins
- Use HTTPS in production

#### 3. Network Security
- Configure firewalls to restrict gRPC port access
- Use VPN or private networks for inter-server communication
- Implement network segmentation

#### 4. Data Security
- Encrypt sensitive data at rest
- Use secure database connections
- Implement proper backup encryption
- Regular security audits

### Known Security Limitations

1. **Development Mode**: Current implementation prioritizes functionality over security
2. **No Authentication**: API endpoints are publicly accessible
3. **Insecure gRPC**: Communication between services is unencrypted
4. **No Input Validation**: Limited validation of user inputs
5. **No Rate Limiting**: APIs vulnerable to abuse

### Security Best Practices

#### For Developers
- Never commit secrets or API keys to the repository
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration
- Implement proper error handling without exposing internal details
- Follow secure coding practices
- Regular dependency updates

#### For Deployments
- Use container scanning for Docker images
- Implement network policies in Kubernetes
- Regular security updates of base images
- Monitor for unusual activity
- Implement logging and alerting

#### For Operations
- Regular security assessments
- Penetration testing for production systems
- Access control and privilege management
- Incident response procedures
- Security training for team members

## Vulnerability Disclosure Timeline

1. **Day 0**: Vulnerability reported
2. **Day 1-2**: Acknowledgment and initial triage
3. **Day 3-7**: Investigation and impact assessment
4. **Day 7-30**: Development of fix (timeline depends on severity)
5. **Fix Release**: Coordinated disclosure and release
6. **Post-Release**: Public acknowledgment of reporter (if desired)
